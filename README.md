# 2D Top Down Dungeon RPG
This is my first attempt at game development. I created a top-down 2D wave spawning game where your player fights waves of skeletons. 


## How To Play

You can walk past the portal in the first room to enter the room of skeletons. The skeletons will start to chase you once you are in their range. You can collect the chests to gain coins and kill the skeletons to gain hp. 
Move using WASD and strike using the space bar. You have 10hp before you respawn. 

## Roadmap

- I would like to add more to do with coins and XP. Make a shop to upgrade weapons or skins. 

- I would also like to add different enemies to be spawned alongside the skeletons such as zombies or bats. 

- I would like to add different types of weapons such as bows and arrows or spears.
