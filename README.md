# 2D Top Down Dungeon RPG
This is my first attempt at game development. I created a top-down 2D wave spawning game where your player fights waves of skeletons. 


## How To Play

You can walk past the portal in the first room to enter the room of skeletons. The skeletons will start to chase you once you are in their range. You can collect the chests to gain coins and kill the skeletons to gain hp. 
Move using WASD and strike using the space bar. You have 10hp before you respawn. 

## Lessons Learned

This was my first time using Unity as well as my first time using C#! I learned a lot from this project some of which I will list below:
- I learned inheritance as many of the classes inherit from one another
- I learned a lot about scriptable objects
- I learned how to have enemies track your player
- I learned a lot about the Unity interface
- I learned how to import and use sprites
- and much more!


## Roadmap

- I would like to add more to do with coins and XP. Make a shop to upgrade weapons or skins. 

- I would also like to add different enemies to be spawned alongside the skeletons such as zombies or bats. 

- I would like to add different types of weapons such as bows and arrows or spears. 


## Screenshots

- Here is the spawn point of the game. You are the shirtless character holding the sword. There is an example enemy, with the orange hair, you can test your swings on. There is a portal on the top of this room that teleports you to the large battle arena where you fight the skeletons!

- There are chests littered around the map which each grant 5 coins. Before they are opened the image shows them full of gold, after they are shown as empty.

- There are waves of skeletons that spawn that chase after you. Each skeleton does one damage and has 3 hp. Be careful as they also have a slight knockback effect, but so do you!

- Upon their death, the skeletons grant 1 XP. (As you see at the top the skeletons spawn in the door.)
